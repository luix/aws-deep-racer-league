Dear U.S. Consul,

My daughter Diana Vivero would like to travel to the United States next December
to visit us, her family. I'm Luis Vivero, parent of Diana, and I work as Senior
Software Engineer and Tech Lead at Slickdeals LCC since 2014. I'm an H-1B visa
holder and my company is sponsoring my visa renewal process for another 3 years.
I'm attaching copy of my Social Security card, driver license, I-94 and a copy
of the H-1B renewal process.

I'm paying for Diana's expenses during her travel to visit us: my wife and two
daughters (Diana's siblings). She would like to stay with us few weeks for the
Holidays and maybe again during summer.

I would appreciate that you renew her tourist visa so she can visit us for the
Holidays and again during Summer to attend her daughter's graduation.


and we moved 6 years ago
to Henderson Nevada
